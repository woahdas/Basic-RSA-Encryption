RSA Cryptography Notes:

Encryption Pair = (5,14)
Text: B

B in alphabet = 2, 2^5 = 32, 32(mod(14)) = 4
Encrypted Text: D (D in alphabet is 4)

Decryption Pair = (11, 14)
D = 4
4^11 = 4194304
4194304(mod(14)) = 2

HOW WE GOT THE KEYS:
1) Choose 2 (preferrably gigantic) prime numbers.
P = 2
Q = 7

2) Come up with a number thats the product of those (14), which will become the modulus of the en/de/cryption key.

3)Work out the phi(N, which is 14 here) function. YOU CAN DO THIS by just doing (P-1)(Q-1)

4) Choose a number for e (which was 5). e must be between 1 and phi(N), and then it must be a coprime with N and phi(N)
NOW you will have the encryption key, which is going to be the answer to (3) and (4).

###DECRYPTION###
1) Choose a number d (which was 11) such that d * e * mod(phi(N) = 1.
2) The second number will be N
